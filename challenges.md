# Challenges for Knowing Your Data

## Downloading Data

## MD5

Compute the md5 checksum of example_file.txt.

In a text editor, add, delete, or substitute one character. Save the file and then re-compute the md5 checksum.

## File attributes

Your sequencing center sends you a link to data at `ftp://your.data.is.here/2015-03-24/smith001_R1.fastq.gz`. Before doing anything with it, describe four attributes of the file.

How many reads are in `example_R1.fastq`?

Without opening the file or viewing it with `less`, determine the file type of `no_extension`

Determine whether `example.fasta` contains nucleotide or protein sequence.
